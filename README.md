## Configuration

To configure the Google Sheets integration, I need to replace the scriptURL variable in the JavaScript code with your own Google Apps Script URL. i have created a Google Apps Script to handle the form submissions and connect it to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. Make sure that the Google Apps Script has the necessary permissions to write data to the spreadsheet.
